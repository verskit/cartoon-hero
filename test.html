          1001. Eobard Thawne (Reverse-Flash) <br />Origin: A 25th-century
          criminal who idolized the Flash (Barry Allen) but was rejected,
          leading to a deep hatred. He uses a reversed version of the Speed
          Force to travel back in time and torment Barry Allen. <br />Powers:
          Super-speed, time manipulation, and the ability to vibrate through
          solid objects. Thawne can also travel back in time, altering events
          and creating timelines where he is the victor. <br />Notable Feats: He
          is responsible for killing Barry Allen’s mother, which is a key part
          of Barry's tragic backstory. 2. Hunter Zolomon (Zoom) Origin: Zolomon
          was originally a police profiler who became the new Zoom after a
          tragic event left him paralyzed. He sought to become the Flash's
          greatest foe by manipulating the Speed Force to hurt Barry. Powers:
          Unlike other speedsters, Zolomon doesn't use the Speed Force to run
          faster, but instead alters time, allowing him to "slow down" his
          enemies or speed up himself. Notable Feats: Zolomon believes that true
          heroism is tested by personal tragedy, so he often tries to make Barry
          suffer in order to make him a better hero. He also helped create the
          "Crisis" storyline in the Flash comics. 3. Daniel West (Reverse-Flash
          / New 52) Origin: In the New 52 continuity, Daniel West is Barry
          Allen’s long-lost relative and becomes the Reverse-Flash after being
          granted access to the Speed Force through dark means. Powers: As a
          Reverse-Flash, Daniel West possesses the ability to tap into the Speed
          Force and alter time, much like other speedsters. Notable Feats:
          West’s version of Reverse-Flash is known for being less strategic and
          more emotionally driven, using his powers for personal gain. 4. Jay
          Garrick (Pre-Crisis Reverse-Flash) Origin: This version of
          Reverse-Flash is from an alternate Earth where Jay Garrick, the
          original Flash, has a villainous counterpart. Powers: He has
          super-speed and the ability to manipulate time, though his role as
          Reverse-Flash is less well-known compared to Thawne or Zolomon. 5.
          Zoom (Caitlin Snow's Alternate Earth Version) Origin: On Earth-2, Zoom
          was revealed to be an alternate version of Caitlin Snow, a.k.a. Killer
          Frost, who became a speedster and was a major antagonist to the Flash.
          Powers: Similar to other speedsters, this Zoom uses enhanced speed and
          manipulation of the Speed Force to attack and terrorize. These are
          some of the notable characters who have taken on the title of Zoom or
          Reverse-Flash, each with their own unique methods and motives for
          opposing the Flash.
